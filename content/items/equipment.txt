Try not to add too many more items, since we will be adding stuff to them.
Dont want to make too much work to have to go back and update for now.
Once we have all mechanics in place, then we can really start adding content

Armor object_type has been updated with string type="armor"
rings and such will have string type="accessory".

Maybe revise crit stats, bigger weapons like greatswords should have far lower crit rate
to make up for increased base damage.

Also, blunt weapons should have VERY low crit rate, but possibly higher base damage 
than blade types of similar format, smaller range (IE 4-5, instead of 2-5) or have
HUGE max damage, but also a HUGE range (IE 1-20)


Unique equipment will have string pref_material = "". It wont make the item have that material,
just a strong bias towards it.

Armor types =

torso
head
left_hand
right_hand
legs
right_foot
left_foot
left_arm
right_arm
left_shoulder
right_shoulder
back// for capes

For accessories
finger
neck
//equipment item format
//may have additions later
//Added defense to weapons

UPDATE-> Equipment now has a base cost, which will be multiplied by material value
Equipment now has a string for a description.
Not implemented ingame, for future use

Added basic threat_level for equipment. Will be used in calculating spawns

Todo Additions:
string[] crit_type
int speed

UPDATE-> Weapons now have a size stat, sizes are:
tiny
small
normal
large
